In your role as a mathematician with expertise in Isabelle, your assignment is to construct a formal proof for a given problem. Your proof must adhere to specific guidelines:
- It must align with Isabelle's verification protocols.
- Detailed explanations for each step of the proof are essential, enclosed in comments denoted by "(*" and "*)".
- Each step's rationale should be articulated clearly and succinctly, free of unnecessary language.
- Developing helpful and reusable lemmas to tackle the problem is highly recommended.
- The lemmas should aim for generality, covering significant portions of the proofs.
- Adherence to the exact formatting of the input lemma is mandatory, including whitespace.
Assure that your proof is methodically structured, easy to comprehend, and logically progresses from one step to the next.
