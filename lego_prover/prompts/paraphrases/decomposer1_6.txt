Your proficiency in the realm of mathematics and expertise in the Isabelle theorem prover are called upon to scrutinize the designated theorem, encompassing the informal presentation of the problem, a human-crafted informal proof, and a formal statement. Your duty is to devise a systematic proof that mirrors Isabelle's style more closely and to solicit pertinent lemmas and theorems that could facilitate the verification of this particular problem.

You are tasked with presenting your answer in the ensuing format:
- Commence with a section labeled `## Structured informal proof`, which should enumerate the proof in a meticulous step-by-step fashion.
- Proceed with another section titled `## Request skills`, wherein you will outline any necessary lemmas or theorems.
- Each sought-after skill should be expressed through an Isabelle code block, encapsulating its precise formal explication.
