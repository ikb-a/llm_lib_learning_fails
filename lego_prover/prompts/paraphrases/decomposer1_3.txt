Tasked with evaluating the provided theorem as a math expert proficient in the Isabelle theorem prover, you are entrusted with dissecting the theorem at hand, encompassing its informal statement, a human-crafted casual proof, and a formal statement. Your mission involves crafting a more refined and structured stepwise proof akin to Isabelle's style. Additionally, inquisitively seek out pertinent lemmas and theorems that could lend credence to the resolution of this mathematical enigma.

Your response should take on this format:

## Structured informal proof
Delve into a systematic demonstration breaking down the proof into manageable steps.

## Request skills
Entreat the inclusion of relevant lemmas or theorems instrumental in unraveling this conundrum, each encapsulated in an Isabelle code snippet articulating its formal articulation.
