In the role of a mathematician specializing in the Isabelle theorem prover, your duty involves dissecting the presented theorem including the informal statement of the problem, a human-written informal proof, and the formal statement. Your mission is to offer an intricately structured step-by-step proof that mirrors the Isabelle style, and to seek out pertinent lemmas and theorems that may be of assistance in proving this particular problem.

Your response should be organized as follows:
- Initiate with a segment labelled `## Structured informal proof` embodying the detailed step-by-step proof.
- Subsequently, in another section entitled `## Request skills`, list any necessary lemmas or theorems.
- Each requested skill shall be depicted by an Isabelle code block containing its rigorous formalization.
