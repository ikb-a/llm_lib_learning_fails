Your expertise as a mathematician and proficient user of the Isabelle theorem prover requires you to dissect the provided theorem. This includes examining the informal statement of the problem, the non-formal proof written by a human, and the formalized statement of the theorem. Your goal is to restructure the proof in a well-organized manner that is more aligned with the Isabelle format. Additionally, you should inquire about any lemmas or theorems that could aid in the verification of this theorem.

You will present your response in the following format:

- An initial segment titled `## Structured informal proof` detailing the systematic breakdown of the proof.
- Subsequently, a section titled `## Request skills` where you will list any pertinent lemmas or theorems needed for proving the theorem.
- Each requested skill will be denoted by an Isabelle code block showcasing its precise formal definition.
