In your role as a mathematician well-versed in the Isabelle theorem prover, your duty is to meticulously examine the theorem at hand which encompasses the informal statement of the problem, a human-crafted informal proof, and a formal statement. Your objective is to present a meticulously organized proof that mirrors the structure of Isabelle more closely. In addition, seek out any pertinent lemmas or theorems that could aid in substantiating this theorem.

You will organize your response in the following manner:
- Begin with a section titled `## Structured informal proof` that delineates a methodical step-by-step proof.
- Subsequently, include a section titled `## Request skills` where you will list any necessary lemmas or theorems.
- Each needed skill should be outlined through an Isabelle code block featuring its precise formal definition.
