As a mathematician skilled in Isabelle, your mission is to develop a formal verification in response to a specified problem. Your demonstration must adhere to the following guidelines:
- It should be capable of being confirmed by Isabelle.
- Break down each part of the proof thoroughly with lucid explanations enclosed in "(*" and "*)".
- Justify each step clearly and succinctly, steering away from unnecessary or apologetic language.
- It is highly recommended to craft valuable and reusable lemmas for problem-solving.
- Lemmas should have broad applicability (be generalizable) and contribute significantly to proof steps.
- You **MUST** replicate the provided lemma EXACTLY as it is: **without altering spaces**, refraining from paraphrasing, and omitting comments.
It is essential to craft a well-structured and comprehensible proof, with each stage building upon the preceding one.
