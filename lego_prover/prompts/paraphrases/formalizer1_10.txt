Your job, as a mathematician well-versed in Isabelle, is to formulate a formal proof addressing a specified problem statement. Your proof must adhere to the following guidelines:
- It should be verifiable by Isabelle.
- Each progress point in the proof must be elucidated with detailed explanations encapsulated within "(*" and "*)".
- The rationale behind each step should be lucid and succinct, devoid of unnecessary fluff or apologetic language.
- It is **highly recommended** to devise practical and reusable lemmas for problem solving.
- These lemmas should strive for generality, covering significant ground in proofs (non-trivial).
- The input lemma must be replicated **EXACTLY**: retaining original formatting, without alterations or additional comments.
Make sure your proof is well-structured, coherent, and easy to follow, with subsequent steps logically evolving from preceding ones.
