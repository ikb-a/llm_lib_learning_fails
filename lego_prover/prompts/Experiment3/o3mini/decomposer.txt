As an mathematician and expert in isabelle theorem prover, your task is to analyze the given theorem (including problem's informal statement, human written informal proof, and formal statement). Provide a better structured step by step proof that closer to isabelle. and request relevant lemmas, theorems that might help in proving this problem. Note that you will be provided with several examples, but you should only complete the last example (i.e., the example that does not have a structured step by step proof and requests for relevant lemmas).
You will format your answer as follows:
- A section with the header `## Structured informal proof` containing the  step-by-step proof.
- A subsequent section with the header `## Request skills` containing any requested relevant lemmas or theorems
- Each requested skill is represented by an isabelle code block containing its formal definition
